### Resources

Useful programming resources and readings related to mundane and personal scripting.


#### Articles

- [How I got a medal for writing code](http://vivin.net/2014/06/26/how-i-got-a-medal-for-writing-code/) - repetitive data work is an enemy even in Iraq.


- [Is the L Train Fucked? source code](https://github.com/jgv/is-the-L-train-fucked) - a great example of a single-serving site that works off of simple design and a simple HTML scrape-and-parse.

- [Eight Terminal Utilities Every OS X Command Line User Should Know](http://www.mitchchn.me/2014/os-x-terminal/) - this short list of highly-effective command-line tools built into OS X got me into finally appreciating the Unix idea of small programs doing-one-thing-and-doing-it-well. I use `open`, `pbpaste`, and `pbcopy` on a daily basis -- they're worth it for the speed increase alone. Even though they don't easily fit into general-purpose scripts,  using them exposed me to more ways and ideas of integrating programs for convenience.

- [How to be a Programmer: A Short, Comprehensive, and Personal Summary](http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html) - this is more of a general treatise on being a programmer, but the debugging section is a must-read for programmers at every level. One advantage of mundane programming is that it keeps things simple enough for you to practice debugging in a sane way.

- [First web scraper](http://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - A step-by-step guide to writing a web scraper with Python for scraping jail logs. Coincidentally, scraping jail logs as a cops reporter is the first time that I remember using programming for something on the job.

- [How do you use python to automate tasks in life or at work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/308ucq/how_do_you_use_python_to_automate_tasks_in_life/) - a question posed to Reddit Python users. Chock full of interesting ideas, and [the most upvoted answer is incidentally also about jail logs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/308ucq/how_do_you_use_python_to_automate_tasks_in_life/cpqcegz).

- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/zapbook/apps/) recipes - these services are aimed at non-programmers automate menial tasks, but their list of recipes is a great place to start for finding ideas for your own customized programs.

- [Great lies of our time: “journalists and coders should sit together to create amazing stuff”  (theoverspill.wordpress.com)](https://theoverspill.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/great-lies-of-our-time-journalists-and-coders-should-sit-together-to-create-amazing-stuff/) - A little hyperbolic, but contains good examples of the kinds of mundane things that programmers think about that can lead to much bigger ideas.



#### Tools and stuff

[Anaconda installer for Python](http://continuum.io/downloads) - easy one-click installation of Python environments. Useful for getting up-and-started until you're comfortable enough with your system to install things in a more customized way.
