## Guidelines

- DIY
- Do one thing and do it well
- Don't let perfection be the enemy of good
- Keep it simple stupid
- No test-driven development
- Minimal viable product
- You are the most important user
- Be lazy
- Iterate

Don't do anything unless it helps **you**:

- Is writing the script educational?
- Does the script do something useful?

Many examples here are written in a command-line, functional style. Not because that's always the ideal way to do things, but because I felt like doing it that way. Writing things to use from the command-line necessarily creates a lot of cruft, but it makes the scripts much more usable to me. The functional-style makes it easier to revisit and re-use some of the components in future projects.




## Motivations

- Learn how to debug
- Learn about designing programmatic interfaces
- Get used to learning APIs
- Get used to installing and trying out different libraries and languages
- 



## Not quite accurate/helpful beliefs about programming

- Programming is easy
- Programming should only be done for really amazing or nerdy things.
- Programming should produce a webpage or startup
- Programming is solely a mental pursuit
- There are things that can only be done via programming
- Memorizing syntax and libraries and intricate rules is key for being successful at programming 
- Programming is not math
