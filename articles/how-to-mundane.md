# How to learn?

Basically, learn how to debug.

# Is it worth the time?
Maybe.


## Things to focus on

- Debugging
- Learning the command-line
- Learning OS hacks
- System environment
- Working with and deserializing text files
- Github
- Designing a user (text-based) interface
- Understanding do-one-thing-do-it minimalism
- Learning APIs
- Integrating new libraries
- Refactoring code
- Some error handling
- Self-documenting code style
- Following best practices in style
- Reducing file clutter
- Creating environments

## Things to not worry about

- Object-oriented programming
- Web publishing
- Test driven development
- Documentation (in the form of comments)
- Complete DRY
- Optimization
- Big O notation
- Feature creep

## Learn one, or two new things at a time. 
Don't replace your whole process. For example, this [thorough webscraping tutorial](http://newcoder.io/scrape/) might be _too_ thorough, as it introduces:

- Setting the Scraper environment
- Building the project folder
- Using SQLAlchemy
- Setting up Posgres
- Writing the parser
- Writing the spider
- Setting up cron

Focus on one thing at a time. Figure out the parser. And just use that. Then move on to spidering. And then move to deserialization. And then, later, to databases.
