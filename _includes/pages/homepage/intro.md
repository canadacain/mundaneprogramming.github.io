## Be a Better Programmer with Mundane Programming

This is a repository of thoughts and guides on finding everyday reasons to program. 

Computers were _made_ to do mundane tasks for us. And programming is how we tell computers how to do those tasks. If you lack exciting, imaginative ideas, then tell boring ideas to your computer. They make for essential programming practice. Even when you barely succeed at it, you'll reduce the mundane tasks in your life and increase what you can tell a computer to do for you.

If you want to program and to program well, don't wait until you have a world-changing idea, or a job with programming in its title. You have plenty of reasons to program today, and to program tomorrow.

### SRCCON 2015 

Presented by [Dan Nguyen](http://danwin.com)([@dancow](https://twitter.com/dancow)) and [Geoff Hing](https://twitter.com/geoffhing)(@geoffhing)[https://twitter.com/geoffhing] at [SRCCON 2015](http://srccon.org/).

[SRCCON 2015 Session Proposal](http://srccon.org/sessions/#proposal-106215):

> Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. So this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.
