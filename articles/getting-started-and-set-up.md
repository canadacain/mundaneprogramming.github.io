title: Getting Set Up for Mundane Programming
description: Some practical tips on how to set up your system and development environment for more frictionless mundanity.

## Python

Use [Anaconda, which provides one-click installers](http://continuum.io/downloads) for major operating systems in both 2.x and 3.x flavor. Make sure you're downloading the right version.

Lorem about using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [pyenv (OSX only)](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). Include some links but not necessary to go into great detail...users should be encouraged to make do with their current system, even if it isn't optimal because nothing ever is.



### Paths and environments

Some tips:

Create a `~/myscripts` directory and stash everything there. If you're on multiple computers attached to a Dropbox, I like to use `~/Dropbox/myscripts`


bash_profile etc etc etc Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Temporibus accusamus vitae tempora veniam aspernatur, aliquid nemo dignissimos eos reprehenderit, asperiores dolorum praesentium vel saepe pariatur rem, repudiandae recusandae sapiente non!



## What language

Python

### Ruby

Ruby is fun. It lets you be creative. This is not a good thing if you are new to programming.

### PHP

PHP is fine. But building a website, or a WordPress site, is usually not an everyday task.

### R
Hadley Wickham, among others, are making R very usable. But it's not as well-supported as Python, or as multi-purpose.

### JavaScript
Again, great for building webpages. Good to iffy for anything else.

### Java
A great language for going into enterprise. Not for personal programming.
