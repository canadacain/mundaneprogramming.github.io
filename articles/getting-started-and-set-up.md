description: Some practical tips on how to set up your system and development environment for more frictionless mundanity.

## Python

Use [Anaconda, which provides one-click installers](http://continuum.io/downloads) for major operating systems in both 2.x and 3.x flavor. Make sure you're downloading the right version.

Lorem about using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [pyenv (OSX only)](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). Include some links but not necessary to go into great detail...users should be encouraged to make do with their current system, even if it isn't optimal because nothing ever is.



### Paths and environments

Some tips:

Create a `~/myscripts` directory and stash everything there. If you're on multiple computers attached to a Dropbox, I like to use `~/Dropbox/myscripts`
