## Python

Use [Anaconda, which provides one-click installers](http://continuum.io/downloads) for major operating systems in both 2.x and 3.x flavor. Make sure you're downloading the right version.

Lorem about using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [pyenv (OSX only)](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). Include some links but not necessary to go into great detail...users should be encouraged to make do with their current system, even if it isn't optimal because nothing ever is.



### Paths and environments

Some tips:

Create a `~/myscripts` directory and stash everything there. If you're on multiple computers attached to a Dropbox, I like to use `~/Dropbox/myscripts`


bash_profile etc etc etc Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Temporibus accusamus vitae tempora veniam aspernatur, aliquid nemo dignissimos eos reprehenderit, asperiores dolorum praesentium vel saepe pariatur rem, repudiandae recusandae sapiente non!
