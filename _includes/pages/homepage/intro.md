This is a collection of thoughts and guides on how to program for today, and how to program for tomorrow.

By _tomorrow_, I don't mean the _Tomorrow of Our Children's Future_-kind-of-_tomorrow_. I mean, literally, _tomorrow_. As in, when you wake up tomorrow morning, what can you program while drinking your first cup of coffee? Or during your lunch break, or as part of your normally non-programming job?
